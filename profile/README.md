# Groove Ledger 🎛️📀

**Groove Ledger** is a personal listening journal for curated album journeys.

It helps you track meaningful music lists, log what you’ve listened to, and reflect on how your taste evolves over time.

Not a streaming service.  
Not a global metadata database.  
Not another social network.

Just a structured record of your musical path.

## Why the name?

A **groove** is the spiral carved into a vinyl record — the path where the music lives.  
A **ledger** is a record of events over time.

**Groove Ledger = a structured record of your musical journey.**

## What it stands for

- Thoughtful curation over infinite scrolling
- Personal progress over public performance
- Simplicity over feature overload
- Ownership of your listening history

Music is deeply personal.  
Lists are not absolute truths — they are navigation tools through an overwhelming catalog.

Groove Ledger exists to help you explore intentionally.

### Motto

> Log the listen. Keep the groove.
